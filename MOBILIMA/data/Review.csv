The Shawshank Redemption,Danxu,5,"The Oscars were overshadowed by the rising ""Forrest Gump"". but as time goes by. the film has surpassed ""Forrest Gump"" in the hearts of more and more people. Whenever the reality makes me tired to produce a sense of powerlessness. turn to this disc. it regains strength. Without a doubt. this film ranks among the top three must-see movies for men!"
